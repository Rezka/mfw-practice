        <p>
          I was born and raised in here in Fresno California, and have always want to change the world around me.
           I just never know how to do it. Decided sometime ago to change that. Went to an entreprenurship school,
           graduated, got homeless, tried to go to UC Merced but couldn't because being too poor, stayed homeless,
           networked, worked, prayed. I am now going to be getting my web development education here, and hopefully
            get a job in it while strating college classes at FCC in january to learn Political Science and Sociaology.
